# For HTML5-capable browsers, file uploads happen through a series of requests.
#
# 1. Client tells server that one or more files are about to be uploaded; the
#    server responds with a "job ID" that the client should use for the rest of
#    the upload.
#
# 2. For each file (sequentially):
#    a. Client tells server the name, size, and type of the file.
#    b. Client sends server a small-ish blob of data.
#    c. Repeat 2b until the entire file has been uploaded.
#    d. Client tells server that the current file is done.
#
# 3. Repeat 2 until all files have been uploaded.
#
# 4. Client tells server that all files have been uploaded, along with the
#    input ID that this data should be associated with.
#
# Unfortunately this approach will not work for browsers that don't support
# HTML5 File API, but the fallback approach we would like to use (multipart
# form upload, i.e. traditional HTTP POST-based file upload) doesn't work with
# the websockets package's HTTP server at the moment.
